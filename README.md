# <ins> Phonepe Data Visualization  </ins>
## <ins> Summary of the project : </ins>
The entire goal of this project is to fully utilize data visualization techniques. I used the Phonepe github free repository for this. I started by cloning the Phonpe repository to my own repository. After that, I extracted the crucial information and saved it in a CSV file format. 
<br>
I uploaded a stored CSV file to a MySQL database, from which I was able to obtain the required information. SELECT and JOIN functions in MySQL are used by me for retrieval purposes. I create data visualizations like pie charts and bar charts after the data is retrieved. I can use visuals to provide answers to business problem queries using this method.
