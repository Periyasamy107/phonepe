# <ins> Phonepe Data Visualization  </ins>
## <ins> Summary of the project : </ins>
The goal of this project is to make data easier to understand using visual tools. I started by getting data from the Phonepe GitHub repository and saving it as a CSV file. Then, I stored this data in a MySQL database.
<br>
Using MySQL's functions, I got the data I needed from the database. After that, I used pie charts and bar charts to show the data visually. This helps me answer business questions more clearly and provide useful insights.

<br>
- Project Goal: Utilize data visualization techniques to simplify data understanding.
- Data Collection: Started by cloning data from Phonepe GitHub repository and saving it as a CSV file.
- Database Management: Uploaded CSV data to MySQL database for efficient storage.
- Data Retrieval: Used MySQL's SELECT and JOIN functions to fetch required information from the database.
- Visualization: Created pie charts and bar charts to visually represent the data.
- Insight Generation: Visualizations aid in answering business questions clearly and providing actionable insights.
